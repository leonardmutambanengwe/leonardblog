# Welcome to my world! 

I am Leonard, and my world is at the intersection of economics and data science. Mostly. Here I share my thoughts about my experiences with the dismal science of economics, as well as the pervasiveness that is machine learning and artificial intelligence. All this in the light of my involvement with Data Science Zimbabwe, an organization seeking to support Zimbabwe's embracing of cutting edge technology for the 4th Industrial Revolution and beyond. I will get sidetracked frequently, but will almost always find my way back to my destiny. Welcome to my world!

My online cv can be found [here](https://github.com/fastai/fastpages) and you can follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/LeoLENNY1) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/leonardwmutambanengwe/). Do reach out and let's keep the conversation going.
